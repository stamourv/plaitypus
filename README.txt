This is a fork of Matthew Flatt's `plai-typed`, which provides
the `plaitypus` language.

It's meant to be installed with the Racket package manager:

 * In recent versions of DrRacket, choose "Install Package.."
   from the "File" menu, and enter

       plaitypus

   in the dialog.

 * From the comamnd line:

     raco pkg install plaitypus
